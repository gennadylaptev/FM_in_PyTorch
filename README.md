# Factorization Machine in PyTorch
My implementation of Factorization Machine in PyTorch.

The present notebook has been also published as (a Kaggle kernel)[https://www.kaggle.com/gennadylaptev/factorization-machine-implemented-in-pytorch].

The data I used in my experiments can be found in (https://www.kaggle.com/gennadylaptev/dota-heroes-binary)[this dataset on Kaggle]. The original source of the data is (https://www.kaggle.com/c/mlcourse-dota2-win-prediction)[mlcourse.ai: Dota 2 Winner Prediction]. I just extracted hero ids for each of the teams and one-hot encoded them. The data should be placed
